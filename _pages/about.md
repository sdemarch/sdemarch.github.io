Welcome to my page, I am a Post-Doc researcher in Computer Science at [Universit√† degli Studi di Genova](https://unige.it).
After working in the domain of automated configuration I am now focused on verification of learning-enabled systems, Neural Networks in particular.

I am contributing to the development of the learning and verification tool [NeVer 2](https://github.com/nevertools/never2) with [AIMS-Lab](http://www.aimslab.org).
More informations are available in our website [NeVerTools](https://neuralverification.org)
